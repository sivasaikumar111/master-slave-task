Firstly take the ec2 instance of ubuntu flavor with t2 medium without key pair option and name it as master launch the instance
Now go to the instance and install java, jenkins then start the jenkins using systemctl start jenkins
Open a new tab paste the public ip address in the tab and add :8080 to it to launch jenkins
After doing the intial step go back to jenkins ec2 instance in that use the command ssh-keygen to generate ssh keys 
Launch the new instance name it as slave continue and launch the instance without providing any key pair
Go to the master instance go to .ssh directory using cd .ssh command there we have private key and public key read the private key uisng 'cat filename' copy the key
Go to slave instance go to .ssh directory use command vi authorized_key add the copied key from the master and save it
The setup is done do all this will staying in as a ubuntu user only to aviod errors
In jenkins dashboard go to manage jenkins click on node click on create new node give the name of the node and add it
In root directory give the where the job has to run ex: /home/ubuntu/jenkins. give any label name in usage select only build jobs with label expressions in launch via ssh.
In the ssh give the public ip address there and add the credintials in credintials use the public key in host verification key select non-verification key
Finally node will be in online and the connection between master and slave is completed.
